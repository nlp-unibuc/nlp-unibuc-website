Title: Anca Bucur
Slug: people/ancabucur

## Bio 

Anca Bucur is a writer and artist whose practice is embedded in research and theoretical investments. She works with language, sound and image in a disobedient quest for exploring the material-semiotic patterns that these entities may displace, confront and communicate together. In her writings, as well as in her performances, she envisions concepts-characters either as means of affirming a process of de-subjectification or frames for self-colonization. Currently, she is interested in investigating swarm and alien intelligent agents and in exploiting the dynamics that the particles pre – and post – come to figurate separately and in conjunction. She is co-founder of [frACTalia](http://www.fractalia.ro/) publishing house.
