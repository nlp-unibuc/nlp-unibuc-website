Slug: projects/instread


Project PN-IV-P2-2.1-TE-2023-2007, funded by the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, UEFISCDI: "Research Instruments for Text Complexity, Simplification and Readability Assessment".


#### Scientific Project Report 1

# Abstract
<img src="/images/small_roll.svg" alt="RALS" style="width: 350px;float: right;"/>
We develop the first set of instruments for creating simplified texts by assessing lexical complexity and readability in Romanian. Our goals are to reduce the gap in this research field compared with other languages and to propose new methods inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for these tasks. Our project aims to:

1. build and collect a corpus of lexical complexity assessments provided by young adult native Romanian speakers  
1. offer a statistical analysis of the annotations, comparing different text genres and linguistic features
1. train and evaluate deep learning algorithms by leveraging LLMs and compare them with traditional methods  
1. develop a set of tools on the project’s website that can be used to evaluate lexical complexity, assess readability, or simplify new documents.

The main scientific contributions of this project consist of releasing modern readability resources for Romanian to the general public, thereby initiating the development of this field in the local context, reducing the research gap with other well-studied languages, and enabling new interdisciplinary collaborations for future research on text complexity.
