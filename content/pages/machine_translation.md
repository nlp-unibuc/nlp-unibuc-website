<a name="roles"></a>
# Roles

Each person is assigned a role (almost randomly) and must prepare the reading from the **Materials** 
column from the row where their name is added. Materials will be announced shortly.
Consider taking these roles seriously as they account for half of your grade.
Since December, 2 is during a public holiday, we can postpone the presentations for Thursday, December, 8.

<a name="role_aut"></a>
## Author
Pretend you are the main author of the papers, prepare a presentation and talk about:

- Problem definition: present what problems the authors intend to solve and present the context and necessity of why it is important to adress the problems.
- Methodology: present the methodology, the mathematical foundations; find an explanation for why this methodology is suitable for the problems at hand.
- Experimental findings: present the main results, how they compare with previous work.
- Get into as many details as possible; the appendices in the paper should also be covered.

<a name="role_sci"></a>
## Scientific reviewer
You must make a critical evaluation of the paper, not necessarily negative; read the guidelines  and examples from [NIPS](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/ReviewerGuidelines#Examples)

- Summary and contributions: Briefly summarize the paper and its contributions
- Strengths: Describe the strengths of the work. Typical criteria include: soundness of the claims (theoretical grounding, empirical evaluation), significance and novelty of the contribution, and relevance to the Machine Translatiion community.
- Weaknesses: Explain the limitations of this work along the same axes as above.
- Correctness: Are the claims and method correct? Is the empirical methodology correct?
- Clarity: Is the paper well written?
- Additional feedback, comments, suggestions for improvement and questions for the authors
- Overall score

<a name="role_ing"></a>
## Engineer
Implement something related to the paper either on the same dataset or on a new one;  prepare to share the code and some empirical intuition behind the paper.

- Reproducibility: If the original authors already provide the code, try to run it on a new dataset.
- Comments: Are there enough details to reproduce the major results of this work?
- Efficiency: Measure the time it takes to run the code, provide an assement of how suitable the approach is for being run at scale.

<a name="role_vis"></a>
## Visionary
Propose a follow-up research project or a new application; take into account the previous work and existing work being done; take into account ethics and the socio-economic impact:

- Relation to prior work: Is it clearly discussed how this work differs from previous contributions?
- Have the authors adequately addressed the broader impact of their work, including potential negative ethical and societal implications of their work?
- Does the submission raise potential ethical concerns? This includes methods, applications, or data that create or reinforce unfair bias or that have a primary purpose of harm or injury. If so, please explain briefly.

<a name="role_att"></a>
## Attendees
Everyone must ask a question at the end of the presentations to qualify as being present.
Being present at all the presentations will account for 1 bonus point at the end.
