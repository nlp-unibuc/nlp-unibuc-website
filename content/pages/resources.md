Title: Resources

## [Europarl Corpus of Native, Non-native and Translated Texts - ENNTT](http://nlp.unibuc.ro/resources/ENNTT.tar.gz)
- A complete description of this resource is available in Nisioi, S., Rabinovich, E., Dinu, L. P., and Wintner, S., **A Corpus of Native, Non-native and Translated Texts**, accepted at LREC 2016
- For the experiments described in the paper, we used the dataset available [here](/resources/LREC2016_experiment.tar.gz)
- This is a monolingual English corpus of native, non-native and (human) translated texts extracted from the [European Parliament](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/). The translated texts from different source languages represent a subset of the [Haifa Corpus of Translationese](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03611). We preserved the same annotation style and included an ID and the EU state that each member of the European Parliament represents.
- We hope this dataset will facilitate a unified comparative study of translations and language produced by highly fluent non-native speakers, two closely-related phenomena that have only been studied in isolation so far.
- For updates, please check the [official repository](https://github.com/senisioi/enntt-release)



## [Comparing Speech and Text Classification of Native and Non-native English](https://github.com/senisioi/speech-text-features)
- We provide a comparison of speech and text classification of native and non-native English using a subset of the International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English ([ICNALE](http://language.sakura.ne.jp/icnale/))
- The analysis is reported in the paper Nisioi, S., **Comparing Speech and Text Classification on ICNALE**, LREC 2016


## [Romanian Determiners Lexicon - RoDetLexicon 1.1](/resources/RoDetLexicon.pdf)
- The first version of Romanian Determiners Lexicon ([RoDetLexicon 1.1](/resources/RoDetLexicon.pdf)) specifies the relevant features for determiners studied so far during the research project "The structure and interpretation of Romanian Determiner Phrase in Discourse Representation Theory: the determiners". The importance of determiners comes from both syntax and semantics. From the point of view of syntactic theory, specifying the determiner’s relevant features naturally leads to the determination of the parameters of syntactic variation in the Determiner Phrase domain. From the discursive perspective, determinants have a fundamental role, being the most important constituents when it comes to establishing the logical structure of the sentence or of the discourse.
- The feature matrix of each determiner contains morpho-syntactic and semantic features, as they emerged from the studies developed during the project, such as: syntactic category, selectional features, phi-features (person, number, gender), definiteness, quantificational features, cardinality, focus, topic, deixis, proximity, contrastive, location, anaphoric, cataphoric or classifier.
- More details are available [this](http://www.unibuc.ro/depts/limbi/limbi_moderne/docs/2015/noi/16_14_13_26RoDetLexicon.pdf) paper.

## [Degrees of Similarity Between Romanian and Related Languages](/resources/rosim.pdf)
- More details are available in Ciobanu, A.M. and Dinu, L.P.,  **An Etymological Approach to Cross-Language Orthographic Similarity. Application on Romanian**, EMNLP 2014 [PDF](http://emnlp2014.org/papers/pdf/EMNLP2014112.pdf)

## [Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition](https://github.com/senisioi/clwe-ner)
- Experiments on named entity translation using word embeddings are described in Şulea, O. M., Nisioi, S., and Dinu, L. P.,:, **Using Word Embeddings to Translate Named Entities**, LREC2016
- This resource is an annotated parallel corpus of named entities, currently work in progress
