## **Introduction**

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Master's Degree is a research program held in English within the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, at the University of Bucharest. The NLP program is one of the first of its kind in Romania, and it is based on a long and robust tradition, starting with the pioneering work in mathematical and computational linguistics of Solomon Marcus from the "60’s which is continued to the present day by well known researchers names in NLP. 

The main objectives of the Master's Degree are to train specialists with solid knowledge in the field of Natural Language Processing and Information Processing, to provide a vast theoretical and practical training for graduates combined with the latest developments in the field.

We also expect and encourage that part of the graduates of this program will continue to enhance their expertize by pursuing doctoral studies, either at University of Bucharest (within the Computer Science Doctoral School, or at the Interdisciplinary Doctoral School), or abroad, within the institutions of our worldwide partners.

The first year curriculum contains 6 fundamental disciplines, preparatory for the subsequent courses within the program. The second year curriculum contains 5 advanced and specialized disciplines, guiding students towards gaining a complex and interdisciplinary training, being oriented both to research and industry.  Each year's program is supplemented by optional courses to complement students’ knowledge about NLP and Computational Linguistics topics or connex computer science fields. 

The program is based on a powerful and modern teaching staff, with constant presence in the main NLP journals and conferences. We will promote a modern, open and collegial atmosphere, based on the mutual respect and recognition of each member of the community. The Master's Degree is addressed to all members interested in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, will promote gender equality, and will not tolerate any discrimination, regardless of its nature (gender, religion, race, ethnicity, age, etc.).

### Main Domain: **Computer Science**
### Type of program: **full time research master**
### Schedule: **4 semesters / 120 ECTS**
### Academic year: **2020-2021**
### Admission: July &amp; September 2020: **30 state-sponsored grants**
