The Solomon Marcus Center of Computational Linguistics is a multi-disciplinary research area
that addresses the automatic processing of human language for a range of tasks.
We are a high-level research center inside the University of Bucharest, with
our members having gained experience (as graduates, PhD, master students, or
full employees) from the [Faculty of Letters](http://litere.ro/), [Faculty of Foreign Languages
and Literatures](http://lls.unibuc.ro/), and the [Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ro/).

We have a long and robust tradition in Computational Linguistics that roots from
the initiators of Computational Linguistics in Romania: Solomon Marcus, Emanuel Vasiliu and
Alexandra Cornilescu. In our work, we are currently interested  but not limited  to the
following fields: language acquisition, natural languages similarity, lexical similarity, languages
intelligibility, readability,  phono-morpho-syntactic analysis of natural
languages, formal and distributional semantics, (automatic) cognates
identification, authorship identification and pastiche detection, temporality
detection, string similarities, aggregation and categorization multi-criteria
methods, anaphora resolution, corpus analysis, social networks analysis. Both
formal and quantitative approaches (including machine learning) are used
in our investigations.
  
We are interested in developing national and international projects, with
theoretical and practical impact and in sharing common expertise and resources.
