Welcome! We are a team of researchers working
in different multi-disciplinary areas related to natural language processing, digital humanities, machine learning,
computational linguistics and general artificial intelligence. 
Our [team](/people.html) is based in Bucharest, Romania, and consists of people from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ro/) and the [Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures](http://lls.unibuc.ro/).


We have a long and robust tradition in Computational Linguistics that roots from
the initiators of Computational Linguistics in Romania: Solomon Marcus, Emanuel Vasiliu and
Alexandra Cornilescu. In our work, we are currently interested but not limited to the
following fields: language acquisition, natural languages similarity, security and social engineering, lexical similarity, language intelligibility, readability,  phono-morpho-syntactic analysis of natural
languages, formal and distributional semantics, (automatic) cognates
identification, authorship identification and pastiche detection, temporality
detection, string similarities, aggregation and categorization multi-criteria
methods, anaphora resolution, corpus analysis, social networks analysis. Both
formal and quantitative approaches (including machine learning) are used
in our investigations.
  
We are interested in developing national and international research projects, with
theoretical and practical impact and in sharing common expertise and resources.
