Welcome! We are a group of researchers working in different multi-disciplinary areas related to natural language processing, digital humanities, machine learning, digital culture, computational linguistics, arts, and general artificial intelligence. 
Our [team](/people.html) is based in Bucharest, Romania and our backgrounds come from [computer science](http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ro/), arts, [linguistics and literature](http://lls.unibuc.ro/), 


Following the research directions in Mathematical and Computational Linguistics, a tradition that is rooted in the works of Solomon Marcus, we develop interdisciplinary research projects that span across multiple fields: from computational linguistics, security, cognitive computing, and social engineering to digital humanities, art, and digital culture.
  
We aim to develop national and international research projects, to share our expertise, and to build accessible, open resources.
