Welcome! We are a group of researchers working
in different multi-disciplinary areas related to natural language processing, digital humanities, machine learning, digital culture, computational linguistics, arts, and general artificial intelligence. 
Our [team](/people.html) is based in Bucharest, Romania and our backgrounds come from [computer science](http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ro/), arts, [linguistics and literature](http://lls.unibuc.ro/), 


We have a long and robust tradition in Computational Linguistics that roots from
the initiators of Computational Linguistics in Romania: Solomon Marcus, Emanuel Vasiliu and
Alexandra Cornilescu. In our work, we are currently interested in interdisciplinary projects
that span across various fields, from linguistics, digital humanities, art, and digital culture, to language acquisition, psycholinguistics, phonological studies, security and social engineering, formal and distributional semantics, authorship identification, aggregation and categorization, multi-criteria
methods, corpus analysis. Both
formal and quantitative approaches (including machine learning) are used
in our investigations.
  
We are interested in developing national and international research projects, with
theoretical and practical impact and in sharing common expertise and resources.
