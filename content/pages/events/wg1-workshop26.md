The closest metro station is [Piața Romană](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hz9BZ58rsKSPb1QA6) and the metro station [Universitate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6QrVEvpeERa5RD4g9) is also in a walkable distance.

Bucharest is a very crowded city during rush hours (08:00-10:00, 16:00-19:30, sometimes noon), taking the metro or walking can be faster than a car. If your flight leaves around the rush hours, make sure to leave early as it could take over an hour to get to the airport by car.

Bolt and Uber are the most popular ride sharing apps, taxies are generaly cheaper.

From the airport you can take a train to the central station (Gara de Nord), the ticket costs approx 2 eur and you can pay by card inside the train. Also you may take a taxi by ordering it from a machine [like this, bottom of the page](https://www.romania-insider.com/bucharest-airport-city-transport-2022) at the Arrivals Terminal just before going out. You'll have to wait for the taxi across the lane in front of the terminal. There will also be taxies waiting on the right side of the lane, close to the terminal, those are usually more expensive and sometimes negotiate the price. If you want to take a Bolt or Uber from the airport, you'll have to find the car in the designated parking lot.




## Where to Stay
There are plenty of hotels around with rates up to 100 eur/night. If you wish to stay further from the venue, make sure to check public transport options, prefferably the [blue metro line](https://visitbucharest.today/bucharest-metro/) that can get you to Piața Romană. 

When booking hotels, make sure to check the lowest-ranking reviews both on booking and google maps. For those who like to sleep, avoid hotels in the Old Town, the area is packed with nightclubs.

If you're in for a budget, please contact us and we will try to find a really cheap and not-so-fancy option (20 eur/night) at the [University Hotel](https://unibuc.ro/despre-ub/recreere-si-timp-liber/academica-hotel/?lang=en).
