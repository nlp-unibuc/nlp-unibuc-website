## Abstract
Prominent questions about the role of sensory vs. linguistic input in the way we acquire and use language have been extensively studied in the psycholinguistic literature. However, the relative effect of various factors in a person's overall experience on their linguistic system remains unclear. We study this question by making a step forward towards a better understanding of the conceptual perception of colors by color-blind individuals, as reflected in their spontaneous linguistic productions. Using a novel and carefully curated dataset, we show that red-green color-blind speakers use the "red" and "green" color terms in less predictable contexts, and in linguistic environments evoking mental image to a lower extent, when compared to their normal-sighted counterparts. These findings shed some new and interesting light on the role of sensory experience on our linguistic system.

## Short bio
Ella Rabinovich has completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the department of Computer Science at University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Suzanne Stevenson. Her research focuses on computational approaches to the study of various aspects of bilingualism. She explores the unique properties of translated texts and productions of advanced non-native speakers, covering a wide range of syntactic and lexical phenomena and applying state-of-the-art (supervised and unsupervised) machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Additional topics she is interested to include computational social science, informational retrieval, and argumentation mining.

In addition to her work at IBM Research Labs, she is holding a faculty position at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo (Israel).
