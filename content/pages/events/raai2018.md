Title: 2nd International Conference on Recent Advances in Artificial Intelligence (RAAI) 2018
Slug: events/raai2018

## Call for papers
After the success of the [previous RAAI conference](http://unibuc.ro/~conference/raai2017), we decided to organize a second event this year. The main goal of the conference is to bring together active researchers in various fields of Artificial Intelligence, presenting state of the art research topics and projects (published or ongoing work) as well as reports concerning the up to date technologies related to their fields of study. Last but not least, in addition to its dissemination purpose, the conference aims to stimulate the creation of active research networks in the fields of its participants. This yearâ€™s fields of interest are:  Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Information Retrieval and other connected subfields.
