**Abstract**: Fuzzy logic and Opinion Mining


In the last few years, many publications have appeared in the field of Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining. Many solutions of these tasks of these fields are based on Soft Computing techniques, primarily leaded by Deep Learning at the present moment. But there are others which still resort to the use of the classic techniques such as Fuzzy logic. This talk will present a short summary of some of the main points where researchers are using fuzzy logic to deal with typical classic Sentiment Analysis tasks.

**Short bio**
Jesús Serrano-Guerrero is an associate professor of the university of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). He obtained his doctorate under the supervision of José Angel Olivas, professor of the same university and awarded doctor honoris causa by the university of La Plata (Argentina). His research topics are focused on the different applications of artificial intelligence on fields such as information retrieval, recommender systems or sentiment analysis among others. Especially, in this last topic, he has several publications and special issues on topic-tier journals with highly-cited researchers such as Enrique Herrera-Viedma, Francisco Chiclana or Erik Cambria. Furthermore, he is usual reviewer of many journal (Information Sciences, Knowledge-based Systems, Information Processing and Management ….) and serves on the editorial boards of the Journals such as Applied Soft Computing or Frontiers on Artificial Intelligence.

[Ella Rabinovich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x154woMAAAAJ&hl=en), room: 215, second floor, [online access](mailto:sergiu.nisioi@unibuc.ro): **Fifty Shades of Grey: Exploration of the Usage of Color Terms by Color-blind Participants in Online Discussion Platforms**

**Abstract**: Prominent questions about the role of sensory vs. linguistic input in the way we acquire and use language have been extensively studied in the psycholinguistic literature. However, the relative effect of various factors in a person's overall experience on their linguistic system remains unclear. We study this question by making a step forward towards a better understanding of the conceptual perception of colors by color-blind individuals, as reflected in their spontaneous linguistic productions. Using a novel and carefully curated dataset, we show that red-green color-blind speakers use the "red" and "green" color terms in less predictable contexts, and in linguistic environments evoking mental image to a lower extent, when compared to their normal-sighted counterparts. These findings shed some new and interesting light on the role of sensory experience on our linguistic system.

**Short bio**
Ella Rabinovich has completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the department of Computer Science at University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Suzanne Stevenson. Her research focuses on computational approaches to the study of various aspects of bilingualism. She explores the unique properties of translated texts and productions of advanced non-native speakers, covering a wide range of syntactic and lexical phenomena and applying state-of-the-art (supervised and unsupervised) machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Additional topics she is interested to include computational social science, informational retrieval, and argumentation mining.

In addition to her work at IBM Research Labs, she is holding a faculty position at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo (Israel).

- 24 November, 2021, 18:00.  [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) (University of Michigan): **The Ups and Downs of Word Embeddings**, [Online access here](https://zoom.us/j/7765926114).

**Abstract**: Word embeddings have largely been a "success story" in our field. They have enabled progress in numerous language processing applications, and have facilitated the application of large-scale language analyses in other domains, such as social sciences and humanities.  While less talked about, word embeddings also have many shortcomings -- instability, lack of transparency, biases, and more. In this talk, I will review the "ups" and "downs" of word embeddings, discuss tradeoffs, and chart potential future research directions to address some of the downsides of these word representations. 

**About Rada Mihalcea:** is the Janice M. Jenkins Collegiate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and the Director of the Michigan Artificial Intelligence Lab. Her research interests are in computational linguistics, with a focus on lexical semantics, computational social sciences, and multimodal language processing. She serves or has served on the editorial boards of the Journals of Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluations, Natural Language Engineering, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, and Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics. She was a program co-chair for EMNLP 2009 and ACL 2011, and a general chair for North American ACL 2015 and SEM 2019. She directs multiple diversity and mentorship initiatives, including Girls Encoded and the ACL Year-Round Mentorship program. She currently serves as ACL President. She is the recipient of a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers awarded by President Obama (2009), and was named an ACM Fellow (2019) and an AAAI Fellow (2021). In 2013, she was made an honorary citizen of her hometown of Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
