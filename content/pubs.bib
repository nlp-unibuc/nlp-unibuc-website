    abstract = "The following paper presents the outcomes of a collaborative experiment on human evaluation from the ReproNLP 2024 shared task, track B, part of the ReproHum project. For this paper, we evaluated a QAG (question-answer generation) system centered on English children{'}s storybooks that was presented in a previous research, by using human evaluators for the study. The system generated relevant QA (Question-Answer) pairs based on a dataset with storybooks for early education (kindergarten up to middle school) called FairytaleQA. In the framework of the ReproHum project, we first outline the previous paper and the reproduction strategy that has been decided upon. The complete setup of the first human evaluation is then described, along with the modifications required to replicate it. We also add other relevant related works on this subject. In conclusion, we juxtapose the replication outcomes with those documented in the cited publication. Additionally, we explore the general features of this endeavor as well as its shortcomings.",

In this paper, we propose a computational approach for discriminating between cognates and borrowings, one of the most difficult tasks in historical linguistics. We compare the discriminative power of graphic and phonetic features and we analyze the underlying linguistic factors that prove relevant in the classification task. We perform experiments for pairs of languages in the Romance language family (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian), based on a comprehensive database of Romance cognates and borrowings. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts of this kind and the most comprehensive in terms of covered languages.",

Our analysis confirms previous results on this task and show that automatic methods are able to reach approximately 70{\textbackslash}{\%} accuracy at predicting what type of additional content is needed to mitigate sensationalistic posts on social media. Furthermore, we provide a qualitative analysis of the results, showing that the models may do better in practice than the metric indicates since the evaluate does not depend only on the predictor, but also on the typology we choose to define clickbait spoiling.",

We present and analyze the results we obtained in the closed track of sub-task 1 (Similar languages and language varieties) and sub-task 2 (Arabic dialects). For sub-task 1 we used a logistic regression classifier with tf-idf feature weighting and for sub-task 2 a character-based string kernel with an SVM classifier. Our results show that good accuracy scores can be obtained with limited feature and model engineering. While certain limitations are to be acknowledged, our approach worked surprisingly well for out-of-domain, social media data, with 0.898 accuracy (3rd place) for dataset B1 and 0.838 accuracy (4th place) for dataset B2.}

We compiled a multilingual parallel corpus from different versions of \textit{Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-philosophicus}, including the original in German and translations into English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Using this corpus, we compute a similarity measure between propositions and render a visual network of relations for different languages.}
